## What?

ShiCo is a tool for visualizing time shifting concepts. We refer to a concept as the set of words which are related to a given seed word. ShiCo uses a set of semantic models (word2vec) spanning a number of years to explore how concepts change over time -- words related to a given concept at time *t=0* may differ from the words related to the same concept at time *t=n*. For example:
